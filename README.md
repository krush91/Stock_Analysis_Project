# Stock_Analysis_Project
This project was to demonstrate database design, ETL and visualisation.

The database schema was created in Postgres. The data was collected from yfinance API and using Python and Pandas was cleaned and formatted as needed.  

Once loaded into the database, Plotly was used to design visualisation graphs that could be used for analysis.
